# spotify stuff

Hi guys, I am a Year 2 Undergraduate from School of Computing at the National University of Singapore.
I am passionate about music, machine learning and data analytics hence I decided to combine my interests together to pull spotify data and kind of do a voice assistant that allows it to access spotify.

The codes are all there and I hope u guys have fun!

In the near future, I will be working on some machine learning models to predict future hit songs as well.
